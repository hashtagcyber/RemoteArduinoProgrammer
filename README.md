# RemoteArduinoProgrammer
Allows me to use ps-remoting to program an AVR remotely

1. Configure the 2nd pc to allow PSRemoting over SSL
2. Change the $localbin variable logic to find the latest .bin file for you (will be based on where your project folders are stored)
3. Write stuffs in arduino ide
4. Use ctrl+alt+s to export compiled binary
5. Run the script.
6. Setup a webcam stream so you can see the blink lights?
